#Project information   

This project is mainly to realize a buffer with singly linked list and linked list cycle for read , write string and file functions by C language. 
 
---------------------------------

#sous-project list for Buffer development#

1. String Buffer - Singly linked list (Single thread) *
(constant node amount, constant node message) 
--- for buffer write, the buffer is default to empty. 


2. String Buffer - Cycle linked list (Single thread) 
(constant node amount, constant node message) 


3. File IO Buffer - Ring linked list (Single thread) 
(constant node amount, dynamic node message) 


4. File IO Buffer - Ring linked list (Multi-thread) 
(constant node amount, dynamic node message) 


---------------------------------

#Project developing progress#

1. String Buffer

 to realize single linked list base on single thread for input and output string to buffer
