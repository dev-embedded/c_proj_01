# c_proj_01
C Language Project 1

1. This is the test project based on C Language.

2. There are 3 files in this root folder: 
	main.c; Makefile; & _README

3. Each sub-folder in this root folder is a sub-project.
	3.1 A sub-project could be a library, a small function, or anything else.
	3.2 There could be .c .h .a .o files created in the sub-folder for this sub-project.
	3.3 The sub-project should be packed inside the sub-folder.
	3.4 Any head file or function to test this sub-project should be put inside the sub-folder

4. The name of the sub-folder could be like: "usage_description".
   i.e. The sub-folder of a sub-project of creating a string library could be: lib_string 
   The reason why I put it in this way is that when we list the sub-folders in alphabetical order later,
   it would be easily to find all the libs (functions, or any other thins) together.

5. The first sub-project is lib_string, created on May 03, 2015.

6. In each sub-folder (sub-project), there could be a README.md file for description, & a REPORT.md file for summary.
